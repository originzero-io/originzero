# OriginZero - Collaborative low-code workflow automation tool

Originzero is a collaborative low-code workflow automation tool designed to empower individuals and businesses to create their own workflows without needing any coding skills. Users can easily build workflows using a drag-and-drop method to add and connect nodes. These nodes operate concurrently (and in parallel when needed), significantly enhancing performance. 

Originzero also allows teams to create their own workspaces, enabling members to collaborate on workflows based on their permission levels. This promotes a collaborative environment where team members can work together efficiently. 

**The tool features an extendable node system, with a goal to continuously expand the number of nodes through contributions from the core team and the community.**
